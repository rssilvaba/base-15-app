the idea here is to use ngrx as store with memoized selectors just to keep state
and we use xstate for app coordination, view and model the app behavior <br />

<div>
  <router-outlet
    (activate)="activate($event)"
    (attach)="attach($event)"
    (deactivate)="deactivate($event)"
    (detach)="detach($event)"
  ></router-outlet>
</div>
<!-- <app-todo-list
  *ngIf="(state$ | async) === 'TodoList'"
  [items]="items$ | async"
></app-todo-list> -->

<div>{{state$ | async | json}}</div>
